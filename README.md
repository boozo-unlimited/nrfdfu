# nrfdfu - Nordic Serial DFU #

This is a C implementation of Nordics DFU protocol over Serial and BLE, targeted for embedded systems where running Python-based `nrfutil` is too heavy-weight.


## Dependencies ##

For Serial and BLE:

  * [JSON-C](https://github.com/json-c/json-c)
  * [ZLib](https://zlib.net/)
  * [LibZIP](https://libzip.org/)

For BLE (optional):

  * [blzlib](https://github.com/infsoft-locaware/blzlib)
  * [BlueZ](http://www.bluez.org/) version 5.49 and higher
  * [libsystemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) SD-Bus library from systemd


## Compile on Ubuntu ##

1.) Install dependencies:

    sudo apt install libjson-c-dev zlib1g-dev libsystemd-dev

2.) Download and build libzip from https://libzip.org/

    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

3.) Download and build blzlib from https://github.com/infsoft-locaware/blzlib for BLE support (optional)

    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

4.) Build nrfdfu:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

You can use the CMake option `BLE_SUPPORT` to disable BLE support and the resulting
library dependencies:

    cmake -S . -B build2 -DBLE_SUPPORT=OFF

Or for Meson:

	meson -Dble_support=disabled build


## Usage ##
```
Usage: nrfdfu serial|ble [options] DFUPKG.zip
Nordic NRF DFU Upgrade with DFUPKG.zip
Options (all):
  -h, --help            Show help
  -v, --verbose=<level> Log level 1 or 2 (-vv)

Options (serial):
  -p, --port <tty>      Serial port (/dev/ttyUSB0)
  -b, --baud <num>      Serial baud rate (115200)
  -c, --cmd <text>      Command to enter DFU mode
  -C, --hexcmd <hex>    Command to enter DFU mode in HEX
  -t, --timeout <num>   Timeout after <num> tries (60)

Options (BLE):
  -a, --addr <mac>      BLE MAC address to connect to
  -t, --atype public|random BLE MAC address type (optional)
  -i, --intf <name>     BT interface name (hci0)
```

Example:

    ./build/nrfdfu serial -p /dev/ttyPL2303 -c dfu ~/dfu-update.zip

This is like typing "dfu" on the serial console (this is optional if the device is already in DFU mode) and then the Nordic DFU Upgrade is started over the same serial port.

    ./build/nrfdfu ble -a 00:11:22:33:44:55 -t random ~/dfu-update.zip

Connect to BLE Device with random address 00:11:22:33:44:55 and start DFU Upgrade procedure.

Use -v or -vv for a more verbose output.
